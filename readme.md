# zeus-bot

Zeus-Bot is a simple Discord bot that sends LinkedIn DMs to your Discord DMs. Setup is pretty easy, make sure you have `node` and the dependencies. Duplicate `config.json.example` and rename as `config.json`, plug your info in and you're good to go!

## Contributing & Bug Reports
I'll try to keep Zeus-Bot working as the Discord/LinkedIn APIs change. If you find a bug, feel free to DM me although I may not have time to fix it. You're always welcome to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request.
